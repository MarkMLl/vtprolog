VT-PROLOG - Very Tiny PROLOG


VT-PROLOG  is a simple prolog interpreter provided with full source code
to encourage experimentation with PROLOG.

Startup
1. Boot the system.
2. Insert the disk containing VTPROLOG.COM in Drive A:
3. If the DOS prompt is not A>, type A: and press the ENTER key to switch
   to drive A:.
4. Switch to the VTPROLOG subdirectory by typing: cd \vtprolog
5. Type VTPROLOG and press RETURN. VTPROLOG should respond with its heading
   and a '-> ' prompt.

Loading a data base
1. You may enter rules and queries directly from the keyboard. The
   syntax of both queries and rules is described below. Be sure to
   terminate all queries, rules and commands with a period.
2. Data bases may be stored as ASCII text files. To read a text file type
   the command:
         @ filename .
   where filename is a legitimate DOS filename.The default extension is
   PRO. If the filename contains a ':', '.' or a '\' then it must be
   enclosed in single quotes. For example, the following are legitimate
   file commands:
         @ wine .
         @ 'b:wine.pro' .
         @ 'c:\prolog\test\wine' .
3. VTPROLOG will read and compile the text file. Any queries included in
   the file will be executed just as if they had been typed from the
   keyboard.
4. Data base files may contain commands to read to other data base files.

Terminating VTPROLOG
1. To exit VTPROLOG, type :
          exit .
   at the '-> ' prompt. Don't forget the period.

VTPROLOG Grammar
   The following BNF describes the syntax of VTPROLOG rules and queries:


     sentence ::- rule | query | command
     rule ::- head '.' | head ':-' tail '.'
     query ::- '?-' tail '.'
     command ::- '@' file_name '.'
     head ::- goal
     tail ::- goal | goal ',' tail
     goal ::- constant | variable | structure
     constant ::- {quoted string} | {token beginning with 'a' .. 'z'}
     variable ::- {identifier beginning with 'A' .. 'Z' or '_' }
     structure ::- functor '(' component_list ')'
     functor ::- {token beginning with 'a' .. 'z'}
     component_list ::- term | term ',' component_list
     term ::- goal | list
     list ::- '[]' | '[' element_list ']'
     element_list ::- term | term ',' element_list | term | term
     file_name ::- {legitimate DOS file name, must be surrounded with
                    single quotes if it contains a '.',':' or '\'}


   Constant,  variable  or  functor names may be up to 80  characters  in
   length.   Constants  beginning  with  capital  letters  or  containing
   imbedded blanks, commas, paraenthesis or periods must be surrounded by
   single quote marks. Lists begin with '[' and end with ']'. Components
   separated by commas and may be constants variables, structures or other
   lists.

   Good  luck  with VTPROLOG.  We would be very interested in hearing  of
   your experiments,  enhancements or even (gasp) bugs that you may find.
